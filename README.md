### Business Problem

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, "average bidding", as an alternative to the existing bidding type called "maximum bidding". One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and would like to do an A/B test to see if averagebidding converts more than maximum bidding. It is waiting for you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success criterion for Bombambomba.com is Purchase. Therefore, the focus should be on the Purchase metric for statistical testing.

There are two separate data sets, the Control and Test group. These datasets are on separate pages of ab_testing.xlsxexcel. Maximum Bidding was applied to the control group and Average Bidding was applied to the test group.
